# Kinyoubi Koding Kata

This is a basic project project to start you off on coding katas. 

## What is a coding Kata?

- In martial arts, like Karate, a Kata is a repeated practise of basic building blocks
- In a Coding kata, we practice basic coding skills by solving a relatively simple problem over an over.
- It is not about solving the problem itself, but about applying techniques we want to focus on
- This is different from solving programming problems on your favorite leet hacking website, in that you focus on how to use your tools, instead of how to find a clever solution or implement an interesting algorithm or datastructure.
- This is not a competition. You will not be measured in any way.
- We will have a 5 minutes wrap up afterwards to share our thoughts.


## Why should we do a coding Kata?

- To take a step back from your day job and focus on your craft
- To get to know your tools better
- To learn something about software engineering in a hands on way
