## Rules of the Kata
Todays Theme is Test Driven Development, so we want to implement the problem below using TDD:

### About Test driven Development
Test Driven Develop is the idea of developing your solution in quick phases called
- red: 
  - Pick a small change you want to make, 
  - start writing a new test for that change
  - run your test suite. we expect that the new test fails.
- green: 
  - Implement the quickest solution possible to make the test pass. 
  - Run your test suite while implementing until all tests pass
- refactor: 
  - Improve the code by refactoring , for example by replacing constants etc.
  - Run your tests often to ensure, your refactoring does not break anything.

While doing that 
- Each time you are done with a phase, make a commit.
- Each time you are done with refactor, start again by picking the next small step


## Problem description
Write a program to solve Fizz Buzz:
- program iterates from i from 1 to 100
- if i is divisible by 3 then the output Fizz
- if i is divisible by 5 then output is Buzz
- if i id divisible by both then output FizzBuzz
- if none of this is true, output i


# Remember to focus on writing good coding using TDD over solving the problem
